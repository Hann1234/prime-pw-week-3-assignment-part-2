      <h2>Check the console...
Looks like if I re-use a variable that is already in a loop, I get an error. I was unable to re-define i or number without getting an error in console. Is this because technically the variables in a loop are "always changing" so if you reset it later it doesnt override what was defined in the previous loop?
